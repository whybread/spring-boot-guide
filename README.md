# Spring Boot Guide
A Spring Boot Guide


## 1. Primary goals are:
- Provide a radically faster and widely accessible getting started experience for all Spring development.
- Be opinionated out of the box, but get out of the way quickly as requirements start to diverge from the defaults.
- Provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projects (e.g. embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, externalized configuration).
- Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration.

## 2. @SpringBootApplication has three major functions:
- `@EnableAutoConfiguration`: enable Spring Bootâ€™s auto-configuration mechanism
- `@ComponentScan`: enable `@Component` scan on the package where the application is located (see the best practices)
- `@Configuration`: allow to register extra beans in the context or import additional configuration classes
