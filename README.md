# Spring Boot Guide
A Spring Boot Guide


1. Primary goals are:
- Provide a radically faster and widely accessible getting started experience for all Spring development.
- Be opinionated out of the box, but get out of the way quickly as requirements start to diverge from the defaults.
- Provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projects (e.g. embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, externalized configuration).
- Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration.

2. @SpringBootApplication has three major functions:
- Enabling component scan
- Set application class itself as a configuration class
- Enabling auto configuring
